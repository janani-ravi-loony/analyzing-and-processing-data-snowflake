# Technologies

# Streamlit

# Streamlit is an open-source Python library that makes it easy to create and share custom web apps for machine learning and data science. By using Streamlit you can quickly build and deploy powerful data applications. For more information about the open-source library, see the Streamlit Library documentation.

# Streamlit in Snowflake helps developers securely build, deploy, and share Streamlit apps on Snowflake’s data cloud. Using Streamlit in Snowflake, you can build applications that process and use data in Snowflake without moving data or application code to an external system.

# Dynamic tables

# Dynamic tables are new declarative way of defining your data pipeline in Snowflake. It's a new kind of Snowflake table which is defined as a query to continuously and automatically materialize the result of that query as a table. Dynamic Tables can join and aggregate across multiple source objects and incrementally update results as sources change.
